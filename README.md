## write cordova plugins in Haxe

cordova works nice with Haxe as you can write your frontend in htnl5/Haxe->JavaScript. But as soon as you need something on the backend side, you need to switch to other languages depending of your target. This library tries to use Haxe on the backend side as well, using Haxe remoting over the cordova way of communicating with the backend. 

This works already quite well for Android/Haxe->java. Some work has been done for Windows/Haxe->c#. And hopefully there is a way for iOS/Haxe->cpp.

In the demo directory, there is a small example, how to get it to run on Android.
